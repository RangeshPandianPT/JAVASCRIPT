/*7. Write a Program to add a property to an object?
The code creates an object obj with a name property set to 'Riya'. Then, it adds a new property age with the value 21. Finally, console.log(obj) prints the updated object, which now contains both name and age properties: { name: 'Riya', age: 21 }.
*/



const obj = { name: 'Riya' };
obj.age = 21;
console.log(obj);
